

 * move the code to set up the hovered tile / queued path out of main (to level??)

 * use aabb to store rects, instead of separate ivec2s
 * test rendering with different ui panel origins / sizes

 * tidy panel stuff (want to define multiple "panels" or screen areas for ui, etc.)
 * change grids to use glm::ivec2 coords instead of glm::size2 (specify coord type)

 * Merge a bunch of headers / code together, so it's less fragmented...

 * Change components to use c_* prefix, instead of comp_
 * Put all the ecs stuff in one place?
 * Put all the util stuff in a rog_defines.cpp file, instead of spreading it around.


UI:

	* Widget to show cycle / turn progress.
	* Show player queued action (highlight the relevant square background?).

PATHFINDING:

	* Bigger level with more obstacles.
	* Varying movement costs for different terrain types.



// map_panel_sb should be stored in screen class
// level should handle pn_to_lv?
