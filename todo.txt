
REDESIGN!

	* throw away the ui code! 
	* we don't actually want to use the screenbuffer for ui... it looks really bad with the square tiles...
	* but we want to keep the square tiles for gameplay!
	* so... we'll need proper boxes with normal font rendering to display info.

BORDERS:

	* Use borders!

MESSAGE LOG:

	* add msg_log to show messages.
	* add boolean flag to show expanded log, with scrolling to view message history.
	* condense identical messages with (x2) etc.

UI:

	* Widget to show cycle / turn progress.
	* Show player queued action (highlight the relevant square background?).

PATHFINDING:

	* Bigger level with more obstacles.
	* Varying movement costs for different terrain types.
