Turn logic:

	* Add player entity creation function (move to rog_player.cpp)
	* Move player movement functions to rog_player.cpp.
	
	* Add energy to the player to enable movement.
	* Add AI (that also accumulate energy).

Mouse input:

	* Do pathfinding to locations, and move there... once per turn
	* Clamp the tick rate to a real-time value.
