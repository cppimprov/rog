Turn logic:

	* Add an ai that moves randomly in bounds (for now).

Mouse input:

	* Do pathfinding to locations, and move there... once per turn
	* Clamp the tick rate to a real-time value.

UI:

	* Widget to show cycle / turn progress.
	* Show player queued action (highlight the relevant square background?).



SOMETIME:

 * Registry shouldn't be part of the level class???
