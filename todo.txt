Level gen:

	* Split feature grid into two layers - floors and walls.
	* Get player movement working again (check both layers).

Stairs:

	* Hardcode some simple levels (say 5).
	* Add stair floor feature.
	* Get stairs working to change levels.

Turn logic:

	* Add energy to the player to enable movement.
	* Add AI (that also accumulate energy).

Mouse input:
	* Do pathfinding to locations, and move there... once per turn
	* Clamp the tick rate to a real-time value.
