Turn logic:

	* Make the user able to pause / resume the game.


	* Move actor stuff to a separate file.
	* Add an ai that moves randomly in bounds (for now).

Mouse input:

	* Do pathfinding to locations, and move there... once per turn
	* Clamp the tick rate to a real-time value.






SOMETIME:

 * Registry shouldn't be part of the level class???
 * Check if action queue is full after getting the input, not before, 
   so we can make an appropriate "nope" noise.
