Input:
	* Use a bool instead of input::button_state, and change m_state in the events to m_pressed.
	* Remove shift_pressed variable.
	* Add some kind of switch between game logic and frames.

Turn logic:

	* Add energy to the player to enable movement.
	* Add AI (that also accumulate energy).

Mouse input:
	* Do pathfinding to locations, and move there... once per turn
	* Clamp the tick rate to a real-time value.
