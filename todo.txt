
 * Simplify the tile renderer -> it should just take vectors of instance data,
 rather than storing them internally, and converting from screen to instance data.
 It shouldn't know anything about the screen buffer. Don't store tile size in tile
 renderer... pass it in with the other data.

 * Move stuff out of `screen` namespace and give functions better names (e.g. draw_screen instead of screen::draw).

 * Merge a bunch of headers / code together, so it's less fragmented...

 * Change components to use c_* prefix, instead of comp_
 * Put all the ecs stuff in one place?
 * Put all the util stuff in a rog_defines.cpp file, instead of spreading it around.


UI:

	* Widget to show cycle / turn progress.
	* Show player queued action (highlight the relevant square background?).

PATHFINDING:

	* Bigger level with more obstacles.

DRAWING:

	* Define screenbuffer region for drawing the level instead of using the whole screen.
