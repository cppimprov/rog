
INPUT STUFF:

we want a ui, which we can interact with at any time...
we want to show the player their queued action(s).

and we want to show the player a "turn timer" widget (a progress bar that fills
up per player turn), so we want the timer to be visible in the main-thread too.

:(

I think maybe we actually need to re-integrate the game / frame logic???






TODO SOMETIME:

use_stairs
	-> should output message in game.
	-> should use mouse for input.

next_depth
	-> check to make sure that we don't go outside dungeon depth.
