
INPUT STUFF:

we want a ui, which we can interact with at any time...
we want to show the player their queued action(s).

and we want to show the player a "turn timer" widget (a progress bar that fills
up per player turn), so we want the timer to be visible in the main-thread too.




move validation isn't correct atm.
we'd need to simulate player movement as we go...
and stuff like "use stairs" can't have stuff queued after it.

hmmmmmmmmm...

maybe we should stick to a single queued action, but allow pathfinding to
automatically add to the queue if there's nothing else queued.






TODO SOMETIME:

use_stairs
	-> should output message in game.
	-> should use mouse for input.

next_depth
	-> check to make sure that we don't go outside dungeon depth.
