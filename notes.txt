
INPUT STUFF:

we want to show the player their queued action (use the path?)


TODO SOMETIME:

use_stairs
	-> should output message in game.
	-> should use mouse for input.

next_depth
	-> check to make sure that we don't go outside dungeon depth.




bigger level for pathfinding tests.
max path length?
